Oficial repo of my modest training 'Python 101' for infosec beginners.

## What is this
· A modest introduction to the python syntax.
· An attempt to contribute to the Internet community.
· A lot of code snippets to learn with examples.
· A lot of recommendations from the trenches about the real skills needed in the battefield.
· A pile of cool exercices to practice some concepts.

## What is not
· An absolute standard of programming.
· An official course given by an expert.
· The best and only way to do things.

Please, do no hesiate to contact me for any aclaration or porpouse.

## Special mentions
This project couldn't be possible without (StackOverflow)[https://stackoverflow.com/tags/python] and (W3Schools)[https://www.w3schools.com/python/]. The first one has a powerful community that solves every hard question, but the other has a lot of sections explaining python better than myself.
