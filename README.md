# python-4-infosec
My modest training 'Python 101' for infosec beginners.

## What is this
- A modest introduction to the python syntax.
- An attempt to contribute to the Internet community.
- A lot of code snippets to learn with examples.
- A lot of recommendations from the trenches about the real skills needed in the battefield.
- A pile of cool exercices to practice some concepts.

## What is not
- An absolute standard of programming.
- An official course given by an expert.
- The best and only way to do things.

Please, do no hesiate to contact me for any aclaration or porpouse by here or by [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Kosmokato).

## Special mentions
This project couldn't be possible without [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/python) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/). The first one has a powerful community that solves every hard question, but the other has a lot of sections explaining python better than myself.
